<h2 class="display display5 overline">My guiding principles</h2>
<h3 class="display">Responsible design, technology, and products</h3>
<p class="first__letter">Iâ€˜ve been tinkering with computers when I was a 10 year old kid, and made my first website in 1999 using Corel Draw and Macromedia Dreamweaver. I started my professional career in 2008 as a Frontend developer in an advertising agency. And, although my primary focus since then has been on designing, my technical experience has accompanied me throughout my adventures.</p>

<p>My curiosity has led me to dig into how mobile platforms work: their interaction patterns and their more technical ins and outs. And that <em>desire to learn</em> has helped me better understand <em>the details that make a difference</em>, save my team <em>time</em>, and improve my <em>communication</em>.</p>

<h4 class="display">Human-driven, not data-driven</h4>
<p>While data is an excellent tool for spotting problems and opportunities, I donâ€˜t think it should <em>drive</em> any decisions, and they can be a double-edged sword if you jump to conclusions too quickly. I have learned the value of <em>qualitative</em> information and the importance of talking to <em>people</em> to understand the <em>why</em> of things. All this helps us define clear goals and scope, identify risks and dependencies, and iteratively achieve better outcomes that deliver a relevant value to our customers.</p>

<h4 class="display">Product vision comes from everyone</h4>
<p>I also believe in involving people from different disciplines and perspectives in the earliest stages of shaping new product ideas. In my experience, this eliminates many uncertainties, and everyoneâ€™s communication and engagement is substantially improved.</p>

<h4 class="display">Design with inclusion in mind</h4>
<p>I believe in the responsible use of design, words, and technology. Mainly because of <em>their potential to be prejudicial or exclude people</em>, but also because I know that better results are achieved at all levels if you <em>do things right</em>. I apply everything I have learned about <em>inclusive design</em> in every new project, and I also invest my time trying to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfIvGBnF4iY">educate others</a> (in Spanish) about the matter.</p>
