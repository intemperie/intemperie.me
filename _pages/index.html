  <h1 class="display display0 display-hint">About</h1>
  <h2 class="display caption">A few things about me</h2>
  <p>I‚Äôm a quiet guy. I‚Äôve never liked to stand out too much. If I‚Äôd have to define myself in one word, that word would be <em>balance</em>. And I try to bring that balance to all the aspects in my life, including work.</p>

  <p>I like things thoroughly thought and organized. Analyze <em>why</em> I am about to do something before I do it, define <em>who</em> is it for, <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> it will happen. That always leads to a better, more meaningful <em>what</em>.</p>

  <p>I‚Äôm aware I can‚Äôt do all that all alone, and I‚Äôm not afraid to say<em>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù</em>. I truly believe it‚Äôs important to empower the people around me to contribute with their point of view from the start of a project, as there‚Äôs always something valuable in it. I love learning from each other in the process.</p>
