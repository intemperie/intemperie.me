<h2 class="display display5 overline">Jun 2019 – Present</h2>
<h3 class="display">Principal product designer, Design system</h3>

<p class="first__letter">The design team reached a point where it was <em>essential</em> to define a shared <em>design system</em> that would avoid <em>fragmentation</em> and make us more <em>efficient</em>. I decided to pass the baton to someone else on the Web to continue the project, already on track, and <em>step forward to help</em> the team in this crucial area.</p>

<p>We took advantage of our previous experience in the Web to lay the foundations of typography, color, and layout for our apps. And with this, we began to create the basic components that were fundamental to migrate all our projects and workflow to <em>Figma</em>. The system’s coverage has not stopped growing since then, and little by little, we are taking it to other projects, aside from product.</p>
