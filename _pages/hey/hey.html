  <section id="about-me" class="wrapper about">
    <h2 class="display display5 caption">About me</h2>
    <h3 class="display">Responsible technology, design, and product</h3>
    <p>I started my career twelve years ago as a Frontend developer in an advertising agency. And, although my primary focus since then has been on designing, my web experience has accompanied me throughout my career.</p>

    <p>My eternal curiosity has led me to be interested in how mobile platforms work: their interaction patterns and their more technical ins and outs. And that desire to learn helps me better understanding <em>the details that make a difference</em>, saving my team time and improving my communication.</p>

    <p>I have a great interest in the responsible use of semantic markup, typography, color, and words. Mainly because of <em>their potential to include or exclude people</em> and because I know that better results are achieved at all levels if you <em>do things right</em>. I try to apply everything I have learned about <em>inclusive design</em> to my work, and I also invest my time in helping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfIvGBnF4iY">raise awareness</a> (in Spanish) about the matter.</p>

    <p>But for my work to have more impact, I needed to learn to <em>analyze and understand problems first</em>, define the goals and scope of each project, and identify its risks and dependencies. In this way, I can make more <em>informed decisions</em> and size, phase-out, or make the necessary trade-offs to achieve an <em>excellent</em> result. I also try to involve the rest of the team to help shape the idea in its earliest stages. In my experience, this eliminates many uncertainties, and everyone’s communication and engagement is substantially improved.</p>


    <h3 class="display">Something more personal</h3>
    <p>I was born in Costa Rica, but I have been living in Spain since I was four years old. I left my city to come to Madrid fourteen years ago to pursue a professional dream, and this dream has not stopped growing since then.</p>

    <p>I have a wife and two little children who are my compass and my engine. Even though they drive me crazy at least five times a day, they make me always <em>learn</em> and rethink life’s essentials.</p>

    <p>I love movies and traveling around the world, and, since right now, my role as a father and the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> prevent me from enjoying those as I would like, I have found a way of escape by gradually renovating and decorating the house we bought one year ago. It helps me clear my mind, work with my hands and apply my creativity in other ways.</p>

    <h3 class="display">Nowadays</h3>
    <p>I work for a Spanish mobility company called <a href="https://cabify.com/en">Cabify</a>. Right now, I’m in charge of leading the design system, defining a common language for all platforms, encouraging teams to collaborate more with each other, and creating together a solid foundation that helps us build better products for our customers.</p>

    <p>Cabify is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cabify">a large company</a> with a culture and a team unique in Spain. I have helped establish the design team, define its identity and processes, and elevate the company’s design in several notches above. The attachment I feel towards this team is considerable, and the challenge ahead of me right now is exciting… but the one you propose at Basecamp represents a <em>unique opportunity</em> for me to continue learning and grow professionally at the <em>highest level</em>.</p>

  <section id="about-us" class="wrapper dim">
    <h2 class="display display5 caption">About us</h2>
    <h3 class="display">You are a reference, for me too</h3>
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books">Your culture and way of working</a> are an ideal that many of us aspire to in our companies. But the two are closely related, and they have to be in the company’s <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to flourish. Fighting from within to change deeply rooted cultures and ways of working is complicated, and it causes a lot of wear and tear.</p>

    <p>Your products breathe that strong and unique personality. Jason did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">a tour of Hey</a> in which he was able to present a product that breaks with everything established without any fireworks so common today. And that made a great impression on me.</p>

    <h3 class="display">I have a lot to contribute to Basecamp</h3>
    <p><a href="http://thinkcage.com/svn/">Like Jason</a>, I’m not a fanboy either. Even the most incredible things can be improved, and I have been fortunate enough to have been able to prove it to myself by working for three years on one of the products I have loved the most in my life: <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>. There I helped improve many essential aspects of the product, its ecosystem, the brand, and the company. All the differences aside, Basecamp reminds me a bit of Sketch.</p>

    <p>But <em>I’m not a rockstar; I’m a long-distance runner</em>. I prefer to do incredible things as a team, with perseverance and dedication, and let my work speak for itself.</p>

    <p>I have experience in many fields and <em>excellent adaptability</em>. I can execute large (or small) projects entirely autonomously and with high quality. Although for that, we will have to get to know each other a little first.</p>

    <p>In addition to that versatility, I further highlight my <em>organizational skills</em>, which help define and improve team standards, making it more efficient and amplifying the value of design and its impact at scale.</p>

    <p>I believe that many of <em>my capacities can explode</em> in an environment more akin to my principles, such as Basecamp. But I also know that I have more specialized areas where I need to <em>improve</em>. I want to have the opportunity to do it by working with brilliant people who help me continue to grow, and that <em>together</em> we can make a better Basecamp for the future.</p>
