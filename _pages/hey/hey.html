  <section id="about-me" class="wrapper">
    <h2 class="display display5 overline">About me</h2>
    <h3 class="display">Responsible technology, design, and product</h3>
    <p class="first__letter">I started my career twelve years ago as a Frontend developer in an advertising agency. And, although my primary focus since then has been on designing, my web experience has accompanied me throughout my career.</p>

    <p>My eternal curiosity has led me to be interested in how mobile platforms work: their interaction patterns and their more technical ins and outs. And that <em>desire to learn</em> helps me better understand <em>the details that make a difference</em>, save my team <em>time</em>, and improve my <em>communication</em>.</p>

    <p>I have a great interest in the responsible use of semantic markup, typography, color, and words. Mainly because of <em>their potential to be prejudicial or exclude people</em>, and because I know that better results are achieved at all levels if you <em>do things right</em>. I try to apply everything I have learned about <em>inclusive design</em> to my work, and I also invest my time in helping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfIvGBnF4iY">raise awareness</a> (in Spanish) about the matter.</p>

    <p>But for my work to have more impact, I needed to learn to <em>analyze and understand problems first</em>, define the goals and scope of each project, and identify its risks and dependencies. Then, I can make more <em>informed decisions</em> and size, phase, or make the necessary trade-offs to achieve <em>excellent results</em>. I also try to involve the rest of the team to help shape the idea in its earliest stages. In my experience, this eliminates many uncertainties, and everyone’s communication and engagement is substantially improved.</p>


    <h3 class="display">Something more personal</h3>
    <p>I was born in Costa Rica, but I have been living in Spain since I was four years old. I left my city to come to Madrid fourteen years ago to pursue a professional dream, which hasn’t stopped growing since then.</p>

    <p>I have a wife and two little children who are my compass and my engine. Even though they drive me crazy at least five times a day, they make me always <em>learn</em> and rethink life’s essentials.</p>

    <p>I love movies and traveling around the world, and, since right now, my role as a father and the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> prevent me from enjoying those as I would like, I have found a way of escape by gradually renovating and decorating the house we bought one year ago. It helps me clear my mind, work with my hands and apply my creativity in other ways.</p>

    <h3 class="display">Nowadays</h3>
    <p>I work for a Spanish mobility company called <a href="https://cabify.com/en">Cabify</a>. Right now, I’m in charge of leading the <em>design system</em>, defining a common language for all platforms, encouraging teams to collaborate more with each other, and creating together a solid foundation that helps us build better products for our customers</p>

    <p>Cabify is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cabify">a large company</a> with a culture and a team unique in Spain. I have helped establish the design team, define its identity and processes, and elevate the role of design inside the company in several notches above. The attachment I feel towards this team is considerable. The challenge ahead of me right now is exciting… but the one you propose at Basecamp represents a <em>unique opportunity</em> for me to continue learning and grow professionally at the <em>highest level</em>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="about-us" class="wrapper dim">
    <h2 class="display display5 overline">About us</h2>
    <h3 class="display">You are a reference, for me too</h3>
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books">Your culture and way of working</a> are an ideal that many of us aspire to in our companies. But the two are closely related, and they have to be in the company’s <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to flourish. Fighting from within to change deeply rooted cultures and ways of working is complicated, and it causes a lot of wear and tear.</p>

    <p>Your products breathe that strong and unique personality. Jason did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">a tour of Hey</a>, in which he was able to present a product that breaks with everything established without all the fanfare so common nowadays. And that <a href="https://twitter.com/pumpkin/status/1273161254526423040?s=21">made a great impression on me</a>.</p>

    <h3 class="display">I have a lot to offer</h3>
    <p><a href="http://thinkcage.com/svn/">Like Jason</a>, I’m not a fanboy either. Even the most incredible things can be improved, and I have been fortunate to prove it to myself by working for three years on one of the products I have <em>loved</em> the most in my life: <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>. There I helped improve many essential aspects of the product, its ecosystem, the brand, and the company, which you can <a href="#sketch">check out in my résumé</a>. All the differences aside, Basecamp reminds me a bit of Sketch.</p>

    <p>But I’m not a rockstar; <em>I’m a long-distance runner</em>. I prefer to keep a low profile, <em>work hard</em> to do incredible things with my team, and let the work speak for itself.</p>

    <p>I have experience in many fields and excellent <em>adaptability</em>. I can execute large (or small) projects autonomously and with high quality. Although for that, we will have to get to know each other a little first.</p>

    <p>In addition to that versatility, I further highlight my <em>organizational skills</em>, which help define and improve team standards, making it more efficient and amplifying the value of design and its impact at scale.</p>

    <p>I believe that many of my capacities can <em>explode</em> in an environment more akin to my principles, such as Basecamp. But I also know that I have areas where I need to <em>improve</em>. I want to have the opportunity to do it by working with brilliant people who can help me continue to grow, and that <em>together</em> we can make a better Basecamp for the future.</p>

          <p>Alberto is one of the most talented product designers I’ve worked with. His work is smart and clean. So focused on patterns, user behaviors, and business goals, away from trends and fads. Working with Alberto, I’ve learned a lot of tips and tricks about HTML/CSS and how to make magic with simple lines of code. He is always willing to help and collaborate with his colleagues—obsessed with optimizing teams’ workflow to be more productive. I would love to work with Alberto again in the near future.</p>

          <p>I had the pleasure of working with Alberto in Jobandtalent and some other personal projects. He is one of the best product designers I have met. As an engineer, one of the things I like most about him is his ability to glue engineers, designers, and product guys together to create great stuff. He has vision and always takes a step back to get the big picture when designing a product feature.</p>

  <section id="resume" class="wrapper dim">
    <h2 class="display display5 overline">Résumé</h2>
    <h3 id="cabify" class="display"><a href="https://cabify.com/en">Cabify</a></h3>
    <h4 id="cabify-design-system" class="display">Principal product designer, Design system <small>Jun 2019 – Present</small></h4>
    <p>The design team reached a point where it was <em>essential</em> to define a shared <em>design system</em> that would avoid <em>fragmentation</em> and make us more <em>efficient</em>. I decided to pass the baton to someone else on the Web to continue the project, already on track, and <em>step forward to help</em> the team in this crucial area.</p>

    <p>We took advantage of our previous experience in the Web to lay the foundations of typography, color, and layout for our apps. And with this, we began to create the basic components that were fundamental to migrate all our projects and workflow to <em>Figma</em>. The system’s coverage has not stopped growing since then, and little by little, we are taking it to other projects, aside from product.</p>

    <p>I have worked intensively to improve <em>communication</em> between designers, focus on <em>common goals</em>, create appropriate rituals and channels, and <em>distribute the system’s ownership among the entire team</em>. And it’s giving us great results.</p>

    <p>At the end of 2019, a Frontend engineer joined the adventure to bring everything we had created in design to <em>production</em>. Adoption is continually improving on internal and external projects.</p>

    <h5 class="display">Other significant tasks I have carried out</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Assumed the administration and organization of <em>Figma</em> and other team tools.</li>
      <li>Led the redefinition of our <em>workflow</em>.</li>
      <li>Led the definition of a <em>career path</em> for product design.</li>
      <li>Redefined our <em>vehicle asset architecture</em>.</li>
      <li>Redesigned the information architecture of the <em>Product handbook</em> from scratch.</li>
      <li>Participated in the formalization of our <em>design principles</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Senior design manager, Web <small>Oct 2018 – Jun 2019</small></h4>
    <p>During this second stage, my focus shifted to driving the growth of the design team in general.</p>

    <p>After having mentored her for nine months, I gave more <em>autonomy</em> to <a href="https://twitter.com/MartadelaF">Marta</a>, the designer I was supporting on the Web, intending to provide her space to grow and level up within the company, a goal <em>she achieved</em> a few months later.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I helped <em>scale</em> the design team, co-defining a hiring process according to the changes that were taking place in the company: from the challenge and its evaluation criteria to the entire interview process. We grew quite a bit that year, attracting highly talented people with great <em>humility</em>. For us, the perfect recipe.</p>

    <p>In the Web team, we reached a point where the different countries in which we operated needed to communicate many nuances that we could not convey from a global website. For this reason, I promoted the creation of <em>Prisma</em>: a custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that would allow us to mold it based on our own particular needs, and thus solve this significant content localization problem that we had, apart from other security, permissions control, and performance problems.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Senior product designer (Team lead), Web <small>Jan 2018 – Oct 2018</small></h4>
    <p>When I came to Cabify, there was no Web team. A sole engineer was dedicated to reactively executing any requests that came to him from different departments—which worked in silos—and a part-time brand designer with no technical skills. Chaos reigned.</p>

    <p>My first responsibility was assuming the role of <em>Team Lead</em> + <em>Product Manager</em> and assemble a team that would remake the web from scratch with <em>quality</em>. I set team dynamics, which helped us work in a more organized way and with clear objectives. I carried out <em>1:1s</em> every two weeks with each team member to ensure everyone was okay and motivated. We had a rocky road ahead of us.</p>

    <p>The most significant challenge was to channel our efforts towards things that generated <em>the most value</em> in the medium-long term. For this, I had to educate, convince, and help the different stakeholders finally align with each other. That was key to be able to define together a strategy and goals for each new section. The Web team had the mission to <em>direct</em> the course and <em>cohesively</em> shape those new sections.</p>

    <p>In parallel, I began to define and train the team on the foundations of a new <em>design system</em> for the web, focused on typography, color, and layout. I promoted the use of <em>semantic markup</em> to improve <em>accessibility</em> and <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>

    <p>We redesigned the main sections of the site: <em>Home</em>, <em>Driver</em>, and <em>Business</em>, moving away from the pure marketing and brand approach that until then had led the project and focusing the discourse <em>on the product and our value proposition</em>. We based all these on an <em>exhaustive investigation</em> of the company’s and our potential clients’ needs we conducted.</p>

    <p>The team grew, and we brought in a Product Manager and an Engineering Manager to spread the workload.</p>

    <h3 id="sketch" class="display">Designer, <a href="https://sketch.com">Sketch</a> <small>Aug 2015 – Dec 2017</small></h3>
    <p>Please note some of these designs have slightly evolved visually since I left, but they keep the essence of the originals.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Technical improvements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Migration of the whole website from <em>Cactus for Mac</em> to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com"><em>Jekyll</em></a>, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/bomberstudios">Ale Muñoz</a>. That allowed us to create a way more powerful static website, which opened the door to many things we did later. </li>
      <li>Complete refactor with new <a href="https://shopify.github.io/liquid/"><em>Liquid</em></a> templates, improved <code>HTML</code> <em>semantics</em>, and modern <code>SCSS</code> and <code>JavaScript</code> <em>architecture</em>.</li>
      <li>Performance improvements, which included: minification, improved server caching and asset fingerprinting, font preloading and <code>swap</code> rendering, and serving per-resolution optimized assets, introducing <em>WebP</em> and new video formats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Support section redesign</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/"><em>Support</em> home page</a>, which serves as a hub for all the information and has a search input field as a central piece of attention. When you click in that field, you get the <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> as suggestions before you start typing.</li>
      <li>That search engine was powered by <a href="https://algolia.com"><em>Algolia</em></a>, which allowed us to perform searches inside our <em>Jekyll</em> articles with <code>JavaScript</code>.</li>
      <li>Previously, the <em>Support</em> section was just a standalone page with a collection of all the questions and answers. But I decided to go further: created standalone pages for each, so the information was easier to browse and search, better for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, but, more importantly, paved the path for writing <a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/troubleshooting/color-management/"><em>better articles</em></a> with way more detail than before. We <a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/licensing-and-sales/">categorized</a> the articles by one or several tags in the <em>front matter</em>.</li>
      <li>I improved the <a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/contact/"><em>Contact</em> form</a> with smart <em>Support</em> article suggestions based on what you were writing as your subject—also powered by <em>Algolia</em>. I added contextual information depending on the topic you chose and defined some description templates to help people complete the form correctly, so we got better information from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Release process: Automation and awareness</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Sketch release process automation, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/samdeane">Sam Deane</a>. The script (among other things) automatically generated one markdown file per release with all the categorized release notes pulled directly from <em>Github</em>. It saved us <em>lots</em> of manual work on each release.</li>
      <li>With these markdown files, I could populate the <a href="https://www.sketch.com/updates/">new <em>Updates</em> page</a> with <em>Jekyll</em>. We had special categories for the highlights, and I added filtering thanks to the <em>front matter</em> metadata.</li>
      <li>A slightly different version of that markdown file was used to feed the <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/"><em>Sparkle</em> update window</a>, which we styled a bit.</li>
      <li>I created a brand <a href="https://www.sketch.com/beta/">new <em>Beta</em> page</a>, on which you can see whether there is a current active beta or not, alongside with better information and context, as we were getting low usage and almost no feedback from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Licensing and sales</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/license-manager/"><em>License Manager</em></a>, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/jelledelaender">Jelle de Laender</a>. It was a rudimentary tool that helped the company software license owners administrate their licenses.</li>
      <li><em>Add seats</em> and <em>Renew license</em> pages (both deprecated), alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/jelledelaender">Jelle de Laender</a>. We better explained the value proposition of <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> subscription model, added a few <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> (pulled automatically from the <em>Support</em> articles), and improved the purchase experience.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/store/edu/"><em>Education licenses</em> form</a>, to help students and institutions get a discount.</li>
      <li>When the subscription model came in, we needed to explain better its value to prevent losing clients, as it was somewhat risky at that time. That’s why I worked on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330175106/https://www.sketch.com/pricing/">new <em>Pricing</em> page</a> (now superseded), which helped our potential new customers make a more <em>informed</em> decision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display"><a href="https://www.sketch.com/docs/">Documentation section</a> enhancements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>As <em>Docs</em> were essential for us, I spent time making significant text style enhancements to enhance readability and visuals.</li>
      <li>Automatic article heading link generation, so we could link to specific sections of an article from <em>Support</em> or <em>Community</em>.</li>
      <li>Sticky navigation, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosgavina">Carlos Gavina</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Extension ecosystem and Developer documentation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I created a <a href="https://www.sketch.com/extensions/">new <em>Extensions</em> section</a> on the site to increase the community <em>awareness</em> of our plugin and integration ecosystem (one of Sketch’s <em>competitive advantages</em> back in the day). We gave space for featuring plugins and helpful integrations, and a search engine.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.sketch.com"><em>Developer</em> site</a> redesign, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/bomberstudios">Ale Muñoz</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Significant app improvements I contributed to shipping</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>v3.6 <a href="https://bohemiancoding.tumblr.com/post/140274303215/sketch-36">Text rendering improvements</a>.</li>
      <li>v3.7 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2016/04/13/sketch-3-7-and-new-symbols/">Symbols redesign</a>.</li>
      <li>v3.9 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2016/07/20/sketch-39-brings-symbol-resizing-and-cloud-beta/">Symbol resizing</a>.</li>
      <li>v41 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2016/11/08/an-iconic-new-look-and-more">Sketch rebranding</a>, <em>WebP</em> support, and <em>Presentation mode</em>.</li>
      <li>v48 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2017/12/07/color-management-sketch-cloud-updates-and-symbol-scaling-in-sketch-48/">Color management</a>.</li>
      <li>Several versions: Improving <code>SVG</code> support.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/extensions/plugins/svgo-compressor/"><em>SVGO compressor</em></a> official plugin.</li>
      <li><em>Bitmap compressor</em> official plugin (deprecated).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="display">Senior product designer, <a href="https://jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a> <small>Nov 2014 – Aug 2015</small></h3>
    <p>I helped the company to improve its processes, learn to formalize product definition properly, and started a shared design system for all the platforms, which were severely fragmented.</p>

    <h3 class="display">Freelance designer <small>Jun 2015 – Oct 2014</small></h3>
    <p>I worked on a couple of projects. The most significant one was the <a href="https://flexibits.com">Flexibits’ website</a> redesign.</p>

    <h3 id="sketch-contract" class="display">Designer (Contract), <a href="https://sketch.com">Sketch</a> <small>Nov 2013 – Apr 2014</small></h3>
    <p>I was part of the team that brought you <em>Sketch 3</em>, which r<em>evolutionized the design app industry</em>.</p>

    <p>As a contractor, my role was to design and develop a whole new website to introduce the latest version to the public. The goals were to sell more copies of the product by giving the brand a more professional look and providing a cohesive and consistent experience throughout the site. We expanded it with new content.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I participated in the app design process with feedback, ideas, and testing. <em>The rest is history</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="display">(Sabbatical) <small>Mar 2013 – Nov 2013</small></h3>
    <p>After experiencing two consecutive company closings within six months, I decided to take some time to <em>breathe</em>, <em>travel</em>, and <em>clear my mind</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="display">Product design lead, Spartanbits <small>Sep 2012 – Feb 2013</small></h3>
    <p>I helped the company with the internal organization, defining the design process and the operability between the Product Design and Engineering teams.</p>

    <p>Simultaneously, I participated in product strategy decisions and started defining deep interaction and user experience changes inside the Go!Chat application, both on Android and iOS. Sadly, the company closed shortly after I started.</p>

    <h3 id="youzee" class="display">Senior product designer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/20/spain-gets-its-own-netflix-today-with-youzees-public-launch/">Youzee</a> <small>Dec 2010 – Sep 2012</small></h3>
    <p>Member of the founding team, I worked on defining the company values, culture, the brand, and the product from the concept to the final state, participating in all kinds of top-level strategic decisions.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Shared responsibilities</h4>
    <p>During that time, <em>I learned how to define and shape products properly</em>, and I did it with a fantastic team: Fran Pérez as director, and Sergio Ruiz. Jorge Correa joined us later and brought fantastic ideas and experience to the team. Apart from shaping, we periodically made design critiques, on which we together improved the visuals, interaction, and words of the product.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Direct responsibilities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducted the initial <em>research</em>, which we used to make more informed decisions.</li>
      <li>Defined and built the <code>HTML5</code> + <code>CSS3</code> code base for the web.</li>
      <li>Conducted all <em>user testing</em>.</li>
      <li>Before the company closed, my latest responsibility was to <em>design the mobile apps</em>, creating a consistent experience among all the devices, but taking advantage of each of their specifics. I was in charge of the iOS app (both iPhone and iPad), which was the starting point for the rest of Youzee’s mobile experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="tuenti" class="display">User Interface designer, <a href="https://tuenti.es">Tuenti</a> <small>May 2010 – Dec 2010</small></h3>
    <p>Tuenti was the biggest social network in Spain, with 9.1 million users when I left. I worked with excellent professionals from 15 different countries and learned a lot from the experience. My time there was short, as the opportunity to join <a href="#youzee"><em>Youzee</em></a> as a founding member came in, and I couldn’t say <em>no</em>.</p>

    <p>I took care of the <em>Games</em> platform and improved the overall <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>, <code>HTML</code>, and <code>CSS</code> with the rest of the team.</p>

    <h3 id="havas" class="display">Arnold 4D <a href="https://www.havas.com">(Havas worldwide)</a></h3>
    <h4 class="display">Senior frontend developer <small>Jul 2009 – May 2010</small></h4>
    <p>I was still a one-man-department, taking care of all the <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, and some <code>JavaScript</code>. I had direct contact with clients, explaining our work and technical strategy. I also coordinated freelance work.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Frontend developer <small>Mar 2008 – Jul 2009</small></h4>
    <p>I was a one-man-department for more than a year.</p>
    <p>I coded several huge sites from scratch and also tweaked and changed a lot made by others. I developed a bunch of top-level coding skills and the ability to work under pressure.</p>
