  <section id="about-me" class="wrapper about">
    <h2 class="display display5 caption">About me</h2>
    <h3 class="display">Responsible technology, design, and product</h3>
    <p class="first__letter">I started my career twelve years ago as a Frontend developer in an advertising agency. And, although my primary focus since then has been on designing, my web experience has accompanied me throughout my career.</p>

    <p>My eternal curiosity has led me to be interested in how mobile platforms work: their interaction patterns and their more technical ins and outs. And that desire to learn helps me better understanding <em>the details that make a difference</em>, saving my team time and improving my communication.</p>

    <p>I have a great interest in the responsible use of semantic markup, typography, color, and words. Mainly because of <em>their potential to be prejudicial or exclude people</em> and because I know that better results are achieved at all levels if you <em>do things right</em>. I try to apply everything I have learned about <em>inclusive design</em> to my work, and I also invest my time in helping <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfIvGBnF4iY">raise awareness</a> (in Spanish) about the matter.</p>

    <p>But for my work to have more impact, I needed to learn to <em>analyze and understand problems first</em>, define the goals and scope of each project, and identify its risks and dependencies. In this way, I can make more <em>informed decisions</em> and size, phase-out, or make the necessary trade-offs to achieve an <em>excellent</em> result. I also try to involve the rest of the team to help shape the idea in its earliest stages. In my experience, this eliminates many uncertainties, and everyone’s communication and engagement is substantially improved.</p>


    <h3 class="display">Something more personal</h3>
    <p>I was born in Costa Rica, but I have been living in Spain since I was four years old. I left my city to come to Madrid fourteen years ago to pursue a professional dream, and this dream has not stopped growing since then.</p>

    <p>I have a wife and two little children who are my compass and my engine. Even though they drive me crazy at least five times a day, they make me always <em>learn</em> and rethink life’s essentials.</p>

    <p>I love movies and traveling around the world, and, since right now, my role as a father and the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> prevent me from enjoying those as I would like, I have found a way of escape by gradually renovating and decorating the house we bought one year ago. It helps me clear my mind, work with my hands and apply my creativity in other ways.</p>

    <h3 class="display">Nowadays</h3>
    <p>I work for a Spanish mobility company called <a href="https://cabify.com/en">Cabify</a>. Right now, I’m in charge of leading the design system, defining a common language for all platforms, encouraging teams to collaborate more with each other, and creating together a solid foundation that helps us build better products for our customers.</p>

    <p>Cabify is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cabify">a large company</a> with a culture and a team unique in Spain. I have helped establish the design team, define its identity and processes, and elevate the company’s design in several notches above. The attachment I feel towards this team is considerable, and the challenge ahead of me right now is exciting… but the one you propose at Basecamp represents a <em>unique opportunity</em> for me to continue learning and grow professionally at the <em>highest level</em>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="about-us" class="wrapper dim">
    <h2 class="display display5 caption">About us</h2>
    <h3 class="display">You are a reference, for me too</h3>
    <p><a href="https://basecamp.com/books">Your culture and way of working</a> are an ideal that many of us aspire to in our companies. But the two are closely related, and they have to be in the company’s <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> to flourish. Fighting from within to change deeply rooted cultures and ways of working is complicated, and it causes a lot of wear and tear.</p>

    <p>Your products breathe that strong and unique personality. Jason did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCeYTysLyGI">a tour of Hey</a> in which he was able to present a product that breaks with everything established without any fireworks so common today. And that made a great impression on me.</p>

    <h3 class="display">I have a lot to contribute to Basecamp</h3>
    <p><a href="http://thinkcage.com/svn/">Like Jason</a>, I’m not a fanboy either. Even the most incredible things can be improved, and I have been fortunate enough to have been able to prove it to myself by working for three years on one of the products I have loved the most in my life: <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>. There I helped improve many essential aspects of the product, its ecosystem, the brand, and the company. All the differences aside, Basecamp reminds me a bit of Sketch.</p>

    <p>But <em>I’m not a rockstar; I’m a long-distance runner</em>. I prefer to do incredible things as a team, with perseverance and dedication, and let my work speak for itself.</p>

    <p>I have experience in many fields and <em>excellent adaptability</em>. I can execute large (or small) projects entirely autonomously and with high quality. Although for that, we will have to get to know each other a little first.</p>

    <p>In addition to that versatility, I further highlight my <em>organizational skills</em>, which help define and improve team standards, making it more efficient and amplifying the value of design and its impact at scale.</p>

    <p>I believe that many of <em>my capacities can explode</em> in an environment more akin to my principles, such as Basecamp. But I also know that I have more specialized areas where I need to <em>improve</em>. I want to have the opportunity to do it by working with brilliant people who help me continue to grow, and that <em>together</em> we can make a better Basecamp for the future.</p>

          <p>If I have to describe him in one word, that would be <em>passion</em>: passion for doing the best work in any aspect of a product’s development and design, passion for creating the best solution for the user, and passion for learning and discover how to improve things. Alberto is one of the smartest product guys I’ve ever worked with, and the more I learned. I hope to work with him again.</p>

          <p>Alberto didn’t just implement my original ideas but looked at different ways to build on and improve them to achieve better results than my initial plans. He also didn’t shy away from advising if any of my ideas wouldn’t work well in the design. Something not everyone is prepared to do, and that I really appreciated at the time. His technical knowledge, coupled with his willingness to see the project through to completion, meaning he’s a valuable asset to any client or company, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him.</p>

He always takes what he does very seriously, and he’s very accurate. In class, he showed a great interest in the contents of it and beyond. He learns very quickly and is constantly searching and learning new things on his own. You can tell he loves it.

    <h2 class="display display5 caption">Résumé</h2>
    <h3 id="cabify" class="display"><a href="https://cabify.com/en">Cabify</a></h3>
    <h4 class="display">Principal product designer, Design system <small>Jun 2019 – Present</small></h4>
    <p>The design team reached a point where it was essential to define a shared design system that would avoid fragmentation and make us more efficient. I decided to pass the baton to someone else on the Web to continue the project, already on track, and step forward to help the team in this crucial area.</p>

    <p>We took advantage of our previous experience in the Web to lay the foundations of typography, color, and layout for our apps. And with this, we began to create the basic components that were fundamental to migrate all our projects and workflow to Figma. The system’s coverage has not stopped growing since then, and little by little, we are taking it to other projects, aside from product.</p>

    <p>I have worked intensively to improve communication between designers, focus on common goals, create appropriate rituals and channels, and distribute the system’s ownership among the entire team. And it is giving us great results.</p>

    <p>At the end of 2019, a Frontend engineer joined the adventure to bring everything we had created in design to production. Adoption is continually improving on internal and external projects.</p>

    <h5 class="display">Other significant tasks I have carried out</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Assume the administration and organization of Figma and other team tools.</li>
      <li>Led the redefinition of our workflow.</li>
      <li>Led the definition of a <em>career path</em> for product design.</li>
      <li>Redefined our vehicle asset architecture.</li>
      <li>Redesigned the information architecture of the <em>Product handbook</em> from scratch.</li>
      <li>Participated in the formalization of our <em>design principles</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Senior design manager, Web <small>Oct 2018 – Jun 2019</small></h4>
    <p>During this second stage, my focus shifted to driving the growth of the design team in general.</p>

    <p>After having mentored her for nine months, I gave more autonomy to <a href="https://twitter.com/MartadelaF">Marta</a>, the designer I was supporting on the Web, intending to provide her space to grow and level up within the company, a goal she achieved a few months later.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, I helped scale the design team, co-defining a hiring process according to the changes that were taking place in the company: from the challenge and its evaluation criteria to the entire interview process. We grew quite a bit that year, attracting highly talented people with great <em>humility</em>. For us, the perfect recipe.</p>

    <p>In the Web team, we reached a point where the different countries in which we operated needed to communicate many nuances that we could not convey from a global website. For this reason, I promoted the creation of <em>Prisma</em>: a custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that would allow us to mold it based on our own particular needs, and thus solve this significant content localization problem that we had, apart from other security, permissions control, and performance problems.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Senior product designer (Team lead), Web <small>Jan 2018 – Oct 2018</small></h4>
    <p>When I came to Cabify, there was no web team. A sole engineer was dedicated to reactively executing any requests that came to him from different departments, which worked in silos, and a part-time brand designer with no technical skills. Chaos reigned.</p>

    <p>My first responsibility was assuming the role of Team Lead + Product Manager and assemble a team that would remake the web from scratch with quality. I set team dynamics, which helped us work in a more organized way and with clear objectives. I carried out 1:1s every two weeks with each team member to ensure everyone was okay and motivated. We had a rocky road ahead of us.</p>

    <p>The most significant challenge was to channel our efforts towards things that generated the most value in the medium-long term. For this, I had to educate, convince, and help the different stakeholders finally align with each other. That was key to be able to define together a strategy and goals for each new section. The Web team had the mission to direct the course and cohesively shape those new sections.</p>

    <p>In parallel, I began to define and train the team on the foundations of a new design system for the web, focused on typography, color, and layout. I tried to improve accessibility and <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> using semantic markup too.</p>

    <p>We redesigned the main sections of the site: Home, Driver, and Business, moving away from the pure marketing and brand approach that until then had led the project, and focusing the discourse on the product and our value proposition. We based all these in an exhaustive investigation of the company’s and our potential clients’ needs we did.</p>

    <p>The team grew, and we brought in a Product Manager and an Engineering Manager to spread the workload.</p>

    <h3 id="sketch" class="display">Designer, <a href="https://sketch.com">Sketch</a> <small>Aug 2015 – Dec 2017</small></h3>
    <p>Please note some of these designs have slightly evolved since I left, but they keep most of the essence.</p>

    <h4 class="display">Technical improvements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Migration of the whole website from <em>Cactus for Mac</em> to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/bomberstudios">Ale Muñoz</a>. That allowed us to create a way more powerful static website, which opened the door to many things we did later. </li>
      <li>Complete refactor with new <em>liquid</em> templates, improved <code>HTML</code> semantics, and modern <code>SCSS/JS</code> architecture.</li>
      <li>Performance improvements, which included: minification, improved server caching and asset fingerprinting, font preloading and <code>swap</code> rendering, and serving per-resolution optimized assets, introducing <em>WebP</em> and new video formats.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Support section redesign</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/">Support home page</a>, which serves as a hub for all the information and has a search input field as a central piece of attention. When you click in that field, you get the <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> as suggestions before you start typing.</li>
      <li>That search engine was powered by <a href="https://algolia.com">Algolia</a>, which allowed us to perform searches inside our <em>Jekyll</em> articles with <code>JS</code>.</li>
      <li>Previously, the support section was just a standalone page with all the questions and answers. But I decided to go further, creating standalone pages for each, so the information was easier to browse and search, better for <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>, but, more importantly, paved the path for writing <a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/troubleshooting/color-management/">better articles</a> with way more detail than before. We <a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/licensing-and-sales/">categorized</a> the articles by one or several tags in the <em>front matter</em>.</li>
      <li>I improved the <a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/contact/">contact form</a> with smart knowledge base article suggestions based on your subject (also powered by <em>Algolia</em>), description templates, and contextual information depending on the topic you choose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Release process: Automation and awareness</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Sketch release process automation, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/samdeane">Sam Deane</a>. The script (among other things) automatically generated one markdown file per release with all the categorized release notes pulled directly from <em>Github</em>. It saved us <em>lots</em> of manual work on each release.</li>
      <li>With these markdown files, I could populate the <a href="https://www.sketch.com/updates/">new Updates page</a> with <em>Jekyll</em>. We had special categories for the highlights, and I added filtering thanks to the <em>front matter</em> metadata.</li>
      <li>A slightly different version of that markdown file was used to feed the <a href="https://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle update window</a>, which we styled a bit.</li>
      <li>I created a brand <a href="https://www.sketch.com/beta/">new Beta page</a>, on which you can see whether there is a current active beta or not, alongside with better information and context, as we were getting low usage and almost no feedback from them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Licensing and sales</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/support/license-manager/">License Manager</a>, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/jelledelaender">Jelle de Laender</a>. It was a rudimentary tool that helped the company software license owners administrate their licenses.</li>
      <li>Add seats and renew license pages (both deprecated), alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/jelledelaender">Jelle de Laender</a>. We better explained the value proposition of <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> subscription model, added a few <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> (pulled automatically from the Support articles), and improved the purchase experience.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/store/edu/">Education licenses form</a>, to help students and institutions get a discount.</li>
      <li>When the subscription model came in, we needed to explain better its value to prevent losing clients, as it was somewhat risky at that time. That’s why I worked on a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190330175106/https://www.sketch.com/pricing/">new Pricing page</a> (now superseded), which helped our potential new customers make a more <em>informed</em> decision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display"><a href="https://www.sketch.com/docs/">Documentation section</a> enhancements</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>As <em>Docs</em> were essential for us, I spent time making significant text style enhancements to enhance readability and visuals.</li>
      <li>Automatic article heading link generation, so we could link to specific sections of an article from <em>Support</em> or <em>Community</em>.</li>
      <li>Sticky navigation, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosgavina">Carlos Gavina</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Extension ecosystem and Developer documentation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I created a <a href="https://www.sketch.com/extensions/">new Extensions section</a> on the site to increase the community <em>awareness</em> of our plugin and integration ecosystem (one of Sketch’s <em>competitive advantages</em> back in the day). We gave space for featuring plugins and helpful integrations, and a search engine.</li>
      <li><a href="https://developer.sketch.com">Developer site</a> redesign, alongside with <a href="https://twitter.com/bomberstudios">Ale Muñoz</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Other</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Jobs section.</li>
      <li>Press section.</li>
      <li>Many other small pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="display">Significant app improvements I contributed to shipping:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>v3.6 <a href="https://bohemiancoding.tumblr.com/post/140274303215/sketch-36">Text rendering improvements</a>.</li>
      <li>v3.7 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2016/04/13/sketch-3-7-and-new-symbols/">Symbols redesign</a>.</li>
      <li>v3.9 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2016/07/20/sketch-39-brings-symbol-resizing-and-cloud-beta/">Symbol resizing</a>.</li>
      <li>v41 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2016/11/08/an-iconic-new-look-and-more">Sketch rebranding</a>, <em>WebP</em> support, and Presentation mode.</li>
      <li>v48 <a href="https://www.sketch.com/blog/2017/12/07/color-management-sketch-cloud-updates-and-symbol-scaling-in-sketch-48/">Color management</a>.</li>
      <li>Several versions: Improving <code>SVG</code> support.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.sketch.com/extensions/plugins/svgo-compressor/"><em>SVGO compressor</em></a> official plugin.</li>
      <li><em>Bitmap compressor</em> official plugin (deprecated).</li>
