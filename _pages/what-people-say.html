          <p>Alberto is an inspiration because of his passion for striving for the best. He also leads by example, and many people at Youzee found his enthusiasm and dedication both inspiring and motivating, including myself. I learned a great deal from Alberto.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Alberto is one of the most talented product designers I’ve worked with. His work is smart and clean. So focused on patterns, user behaviors, and business goals, away from trends and fads. Working with Alberto, I’ve learned a lot of tips and tricks about HTML/CSS and how to make magic with simple lines of code. He is always willing to help and collaborate with his colleagues—obsessed with optimizing teams’ workflow to be more productive. I would love to work with Alberto again in the near future.</p>

          <p>Putting it plainly: Alberto has the biggest CSS knowledge base I’ve encountered in my career. And he’s always interested in new ways of doing things, even from outside of his field. For sure, he’s in the top three of best product guys I’ve worked with.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I had the pleasure of working with Alberto in Jobandtalent and some other personal projects. He is one of the best product designers I have met. As an engineer, one of the things I like most about him is his ability to glue engineers, designers, and product guys together to create great stuff. He has vision and always takes a step back to get the big picture when designing a product feature.</p>

      <li>
        <blockquote>
          <p>If I have to describe him in one word, that would be <em>passion</em>: passion for doing the best work in any aspect of a product’s development and design, passion for creating the best solution for the user, and passion for learning and discover how to improve things. Alberto is one of the smartest product guys I’ve ever worked with, and the more I learned. I hope to work with him again.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Alberto didn’t just implement my original ideas but looked at different ways to build on and improve them to achieve better results than my initial plans. He also didn’t shy away from advising if any of my ideas wouldn’t work well in the design. Something not everyone is prepared to do, and that I really appreciated at the time. His technical knowledge, coupled with his willingness to see the project through to completion, meaning he’s a valuable asset to any client or company, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend him.</p>

          <p>One of the best students I’ve had over the years I have been teaching. Creative, tireless, and always wanting to learn more and more. He always takes what he does very seriously, and he’s very accurate. In class, he showed a great interest in the contents and beyond. He learns very quickly and he is constantly searching and learning new things on his own. You can tell he loves it. Besides, he always showed a very positive attitude, friendly, and collaborative with his peers.</p>
