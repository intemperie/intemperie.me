<p>The design team reached a point where it was <em>essential</em> to define a shared <em>design system</em> that would avoid <em>fragmentation</em> and make us more <em>efficient</em>. I decided to pass the baton to someone else on the Web to continue the project, already on track, and <em>step forward to help</em> the team in this crucial area.</p>

<p>We took advantage of our previous experience in the Web to lay the foundations of typography, color, and layout for our apps. And with this, we began to create the basic components that were fundamental to migrate all our projects and workflow to <em>Figma</em>. The system’s coverage has not stopped growing since then, and little by little, we are taking it to other projects, aside from product.</p>

<p>I have worked intensively to improve <em>communication</em> between designers, focus on <em>common goals</em>, create appropriate rituals and channels, and <em>distribute the system’s ownership among the entire team</em>. And it’s giving us great results.</p>

<p>At the end of 2019, a Frontend engineer joined the adventure to bring everything we had created in design to <em>production</em>. Adoption is continually improving on internal and external projects.</p>

<h5 class="display">Other significant tasks I have carried out</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Assumed the administration and organization of <em>Figma</em> among other Design Ops activities.</li>
  <li>Led the redefinition of the Design <em>workflow</em>, in order to be more organized internally and externally.</li>
  <li>Led the definition of a <em>career path</em> for product design.</li>
  <li>Redefined our <em>vehicle asset architecture</em>.</li>
  <li>Redesigned the information architecture of the <em>Product handbook</em> from scratch.</li>
  <li>Participated in the formalization of our <em>design principles</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>During this second stage, my focus shifted to driving the growth of the design team in general.</p>

<p>After having mentored her for nine months, I gave more <em>autonomy</em> to <a href="https://twitter.com/MartadelaF">Marta</a>, the designer I was supporting on the Web, intending to provide her space to grow and level up within the company, a goal <em>she achieved</em> a few months later.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I helped <em>scale</em> the design team, co-defining a hiring process according to the changes that were taking place in the company: from the challenge and its evaluation criteria to the entire interview process. We grew quite a bit that year, attracting highly talented people with great <em>humility</em>. For us, the perfect recipe.</p>

<p>In the Web team, we reached a point where the different countries in which we operated needed to communicate many nuances that we could not convey from a global website. For this reason, I promoted the creation of <em>Prisma</em>: a custom <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> that would allow us to mold it based on our own particular needs, and thus solve this significant content localization problem that we had, apart from other security, permissions control, and performance problems.</p>

<p>When I came to Cabify, there was no Web team. A sole engineer was dedicated to reactively executing any requests that came to him from different departments—which worked in silos—and a part-time brand designer with no technical skills. Chaos reigned.</p>

<p>My first responsibility was assuming the role of <em>Team Lead</em> + <em>Product Manager</em> and assemble a team that would remake the web from scratch with <em>quality</em>. I set team dynamics, which helped us work in a more organized way and with clear objectives. I carried out <em>1:1s</em> every two weeks with each team member to ensure everyone was okay and motivated. We had a rocky road ahead of us.</p>

<p>The most significant challenge was to channel our efforts towards things that generated <em>the most value</em> in the medium-long term. For this, I had to educate, convince, and help the different stakeholders finally align with each other. That was key to be able to define together a strategy and goals for each new section. The Web team had the mission to <em>direct</em> the course and <em>cohesively</em> shape those new sections.</p>

<p>In parallel, I began to define and train the team on the foundations of a new <em>design system</em> for the web, focused on typography, color, and layout. I promoted the use of <em>semantic markup</em> to improve <em>accessibility</em> and <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</p>

<p>We redesigned the main sections of the site, moving away from the pure marketing and brand approach that until then had led the project and focusing the discourse <em>on the product and our value proposition</em>. We based all these on an <em>exhaustive investigation</em> of the company’s and our potential clients’ needs we conducted.</p>

<p>The team grew, and we brought in a Product Manager and an Engineering Manager to spread the workload.</p>
