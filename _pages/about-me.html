    <h3 class="display">About me</h3>
    <p class="first__letter">I started my professional career in 2008 as a Frontend developer in an advertising agency. And, although my primary focus since then has been on designing, my technical experience has accompanied me throughout my adventures.</p>

    <p>My curiosity has led me to dig into how mobile platforms work: their interaction patterns and their more technical ins and outs. And that <em>desire to learn</em> has helped me better understand <em>the details that make a difference</em>, save my team <em>time</em>, and improve my <em>communication</em>.</p>

    <p>In 2007, I left my job as a computer technician and moved to Madrid to pursue a professional dream: becoming a designer.</p>

    <p>My wife and my two little children are my compass and my engine. Even though they drive me crazy at least five times a day, they always make me <em>learn</em> and rethink life’s essentials.</p>

    <p>I love movies, TV shows, fantasy books, and traveling around the world. But since right now, my role as a father and the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> prevent me from enjoying those as I would like, I have found a way of escape by gradually renovating and decorating the house we bought in 2019. It helps me clear my mind, work with my hands and apply my creativity in other ways.</p>
